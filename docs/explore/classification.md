# Explore by classification

[viewof input: select your group]

[basic stats, in comparison to GC averages]
- number
- occupied vs not
- supervisor vs not
- \# reports?

[career opportunities!?]
- “depth from top” calculation: how easily can someone access EX-1, -3, -5, DM (etc) to provide them the “experience briefing” etc type requirements for job postings—e.g., that’s easier at central agencies than at departments, presumably (“distance to EX” as metric)
- say you’re at level X, and want X or X+n—where can you go? what if you add additional constraints, like geography or organization? [could do a multi select on both!?]
